Qt-VTK
======
A sample program which shows you how to integrate VTK with Qt to make GUI based applications for VTK rendering
and other applications. These files are for Qt Creator and not MS Visual Studio.

The app can be downloaded from the mediafire link: http://www.mediafire.com/download/52rduyli76l7q2q/Qt-VTK-GUI.rar

The RAR file contains the executable app and the required STL files. Change the name of the folder containing the STL files in your system accordingly in the mainwindow.cpp file to visualise STL files without any errors.
